beryx.org-website
=====================

This is the GitHub project of the website **[beryx.org](http://beryx.org)**.

The website makes use of the [Jekyll templating engine](http://jekyllrb.com/), which is integrated into GitHub Pages.
Whenever you push something into this project, GitHub automatically runs Jekyll and serves the content on [beryx.github.io/](http://beryx.github.io/).

### Using Jekyll locally

To test these webpages, first install Ruby, Bundler and Jekyll by following [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/).

Then clone this project to your local folder and run

    $ cd <your-cloned-project-dir>
    $ bundle exec jekyll serve

to serve the webpages locally on `http://localhost:4000/`.
